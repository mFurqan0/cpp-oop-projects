# cpp-oop-projects
This repository is a complete collection of my C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) learning journey. It contains all the practice tasks, mini-projects, and examples I created while learning OOP concepts from scratch to advanced.

The goal of this repo is not only to track my progress but also to showcase my coding skills, problem-solving approach, and understanding of OOP principles in C++. Each topic is covered step by step, with practical code implementations that highlight key concepts like:

Classes and Objects

Constructors & Destructors

Inheritance

Polymorphism (Function Overloading & Overriding)

Encapsulation & Abstraction

Operator Overloading

File Handling in OOP

Real-world mini projects

This repo serves as both a personal practice archive and a portfolio of my skills for future opportunities in software development.
